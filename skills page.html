                <h3>Python</h3>
                <input type="range" id="range" name="range" min="1" max="10" step="1" value="5" required>
                <output for="range" id="range-value">5</output>
                <p>- I would consider myself an intermediate with python. I have been working with it for 2 years
                    and know most of the basic and intermediate concepts.  This includes functions, classes, and OOP structures.
                </p>
                <a href="..."></a>

                <h3>HTML:</h3>
                <input type="range" id="range" name="range" min="1" max="10" step="1" value="1" required>
                <output for="range" id="range-value">1</output>
                <p>- I am a beginner in HTML.  I am currently learning the basics and this page is a learning exercise for me.</p>
                <a href=""></a>

                <h3>JavaScript:</h3>
                <input type="range" id="range" name="range" min="1" max="10" step="1" value="1" required>
                <output for="range" id="range-value">1</output>
                <p>- I would consider myself a beginner in Javascript as well.  Although I started learning this language nearly a year
                    ago, I have not worked with it much in that time. </p>
                <a href=""></a>

                <h3>SQL</h3>
                <input type="range" id="range" name="range" min="1" max="10" step="1" value="3" required>
                <output for="range" id="range-value">3</output>
                <p>- I am quite early on in my understanding of SQL as well but have learned the basics.  I have also
                    learned to work with MySQL Workbench and SQLAlchemy.

                <h2><u>Front End Development</u></h2>
                
                <p>Front end development is something that I have been working on for quite some time.  Originally using sites like shopify and other templates
                    but working towards more custom projects.  This is what got me into programming in the first place.  Below are 2 examples of sites that I have worked on.
                </p>
                <a href="https://healthierbabyliving.com/">Healthier Baby Living</a>
                <p>- This is a site that I build from scratch using the Shopify built in templates.  I did employ some custom code for this site
                    specifically where the product images and descriptions are concerned.
                </p>

                <a href="https://topperfitness.com/">Topper Fitness</a>
                <p>- I had far less to do with this site.  I spent a short amount of time working on the design and formatting for the site.
                    The overall site was already in place when the owner asked that I work on it.
                </p>
